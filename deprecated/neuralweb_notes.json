        "contentText": "Sexual relations within societies are “impaired” by certain regulations, which tend to privilege monogamous, lifelong, male-female procreative unions, as contracted by marriage. These rules are designed to maximize the smoothness of social functioning because male-female family units are the easiest for societies to replicate, and the easiest to govern. A great deal of “variation” might occur from this norm within a society. For example, people might have sex with others of the same gender, or have sex outside marriage. Nevertheless, the social constraints against uninhibited love are significant, and constitute a foundation on which social control is constructed.Sexual frustrations society imposes on individuals cause certain individuals, known as neurotics, to create certain symptoms in response (for example, excessive worry, bodily fixations, or obsessions). These symptoms give the neurotic both pleasure and pain - pain in their existence, and pleasure in the neurotic’s continual attempts to indulge in the symptoms and overcome them.",

Love also contains a sexual component, which is tied to libido, or an individual’s erotic energy. Happiness is a problem of the economics of the individual’s libido. A person becomes happy by figuring out, for himself or herself, how best to manage his or her emotional and sexual energies, within the self or directed toward another person. There is no formula for how to go about managing this economy.This economy of libido is essential to the human phenomenon of happiness, or perceived happiness - and to the idea, then, that humans have of a purpose in life. Some humans wish to share a life with another; others find ego satisfaction in living primarily with themselves. Religion is a mechanism outside the self that aids in the regulation of the instincts of libido - directing love either toward other people (as in Christian commandments to love another as oneself, discussed below) or toward the abstraction of God.",

This universal is not an abstraction, not a limited universal like the instinctive nature of man. It is the very essence of human existence. The human condition, the needs that follow from it, various answers to these needs. It is the content of the unconscious that is common to all man, because of the identity of the existential condition of all man and not because of some racial heritage, like Jung believed.One then experiences oneself and one’s fellow man as variations of the theme man, And may be man as a variation of the theme life. What matters is that which all man share, not that in which they differ.In the process of the full penetration of one’s unconscious, one discovers that we differ considerably in the quantitative aspects, but are same in the quality of our strivings. The exploration of the unconscious in-depth is a way of discovering humanity in onseflf and in every other human being. This discovery is not one of theoretical power, but an experience.",
